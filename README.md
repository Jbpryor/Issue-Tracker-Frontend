This is a website for issue (bug) tracking within a team durring the development process of software.
I originally started this project to further engrain the information that I was learning through the course I was taking on freeCodeCamp.
Some of the biggest hurdles for me that I kept learning was constantly lifting the state.
At first I hard coded the data to make sure it was looking the way I invisioned. Next, I created functions for dynamically rendering the data.
After that I learned the flow of data within components, prop drilling, data only flows from parent to child etc. I then learned to use
useContext to lift the state and shortly after to use Redux to lift the state and so to speak "rain down the data to the other components".
I also moved on to learning the backend which you can see on here. All in all it was an awesome experience with many hurdles that were
so rewarding to break through. Let me know if you have any comments or suggestions for improvement.
